# TRAINING-CONFIDENCE-CALIBRATED-CLASSIFIERS-FOR-DETECTING-OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION-SAMPLES
A PyTorch implementation of the method proposed in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09325 .

Algorithm 1 from the paper is implemented together with code to train and evaluate the prediction accuracy as well as the detection accuracy when the method is trained with CIFAR10 as "in-distribution" and tested with SVHN as "out-of-distribution". 

There are logs from two test runs runnings for 3500 gradient steps, one when only the cross entropy is used to train the classifier and the other with the, in the paper proposed, joint confidence loss. In the one using joint confidence loss, images generated by the GAN can also be seen.
